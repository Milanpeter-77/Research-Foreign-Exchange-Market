## Abstract
This study examines the impact of Hungarian National Bank (MNB) base interest rate increases on the Hungarian forint (HUF) exchange rate during 2021 and 2022. An event study methodology is employed, with a carefully chosen portfolio of foreign currencies representing the HUF exchange rate. Abnormal returns are calculated and analysed using various models and statistical tests, including the Student’s t-test and the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. The findings suggest that interest rate increases have a statistically significant, but potentially slight, negative effect on the HUF exchange rate. While the constant models and the Market-adjusted model with average return focus are not conclusive, the Market Model with regression estimation reveals a significant difference in abnormal returns before and after interest rate hikes. This implies a measurable impact of MNB’s monetary policy on the foreign exchange market. The research contributes to the understanding of the Hungarian foreign exchange market dynamics and the effectiveness of interest rate adjustments. It highlights the importance of considering exchange rate stability when formulating economic strategies and provides valuable insights for international trade, currency investors, and policymakers. The methodological advancements and empirical evidence presented offer valuable resources for both academic research and policymaking in international finance and monetary economics.
